<h1>Assignment - Shapes</h1>
<p>
    This assignment will have you working with the DOM, Strings, and Loops. The goal is to programmatically make 2
    different tables and fill them with certain symbols. As you draw the shapes put a * inside of each cell to
    indicate you filled with something. Each td cell should only have one * in it.
</p>
<p>
    The square table will be 10 cells wide and will be 10 cells tall. Every cell should be filled.<br />
    See the output image for an example.<br />
    Insert your table into the element with #square selector.
</p>
<p>
    The triangle table will start as 1 cell wide and will grow to be 10 cells wide. No empty td elements should exist
    in this table. It should only have cells that are filled. You will draw a right angle triangle with
    the smallest corner in the top left. Each cell that makes up the triangle should use have the * character.<br />
    See the output image for an example.<br />
    Insert your table into the element with #triangle selector.
</p>

<h3>Output:</h3>
<p>The what should be showing on the page: (One with the debugg css on so you can see the cells better)</p>
